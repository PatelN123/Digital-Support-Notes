Information about the insides of the CPU and how they work, as well as factors affecting the performance of a CPU

## Components of a Processor

### The Arithmetic Logic Unit

- Completes all Arithmetical and Logical Operations
- Performs boolean algebra such as AND, OR, NOT, and XOR statements
- Does binary shift

### The Control Unit

- Directs the operations of the CPU
- Manages the flow of data between the CPU and other devices
- Accepts the next instruction of the FDE cycle (see below)
- Decodes instructions
- Stores results of data in memory

### Registers

- Registers are small, high speed, special purpose memory cells
- Temporarily stores data
- Arithmetic, logic and shift operations occur here

#### Types of registers

- Program Counter (PC) - Holds the address of the next instruction to be executed
- Accumulator (ACC) - Stores results from calculations
- Memory Address Register (MAR) - Holds the address of a location that is to be read from or written to
- Memory Data register (MDR) - Temporarily stores data that has been read or data that needs to be written
- Current Instruction Register (CIR) - Holds the current instruction being executed. Divided up into operand and opcode.

### Buses

- Sets of parallel wires which connect two or more components.
- Includes the data bus, control bus and address bus.
- Collectively known as the system bus


#### Data bus

- Bi-directional bus (data can be carried in both directions)
- Trasnsports data and instructions between components of the CPU

#### Address bus

- Transports the memoru addresses, which shows where data is to be sent to or retrieved from.

#### Control bus

- Bi-directional
- Transmits control signals between internal and external CPU components.

### Control signals

- Bus request - shows that a device is requesting use of the data bus
- Bus grant - shows that the CPU has granted access to the data bus
- Memory write - data is written into the addressed location using this bus
- Memory read - data is read from a specific location using this bus
- Interrupt request - Shows that a device is requesting access to the CPU

## The Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle

- A sequence of operations that are completed in order to execute any instruction

### Fetch phase:

- Address from the PC is copied to the MAR
- Instruction held at that address is copied to the MDR by the data bus
- Contents of the PC are incrememnted by +1
- Value held in MDR is copied to the CIR

### Decoding phase:

- Conternts of CIR are split into operand and opcode

### execution phase:

- The decoded instruction is executed.


## Factors affecting CPU performance

- There are three factors that affect the performance of the CPU, clock speed, the number of cores it has, and its amount of cache memory

### Clock speed

- Determined by the system clock, an electronic device which sends a signal, switching between a value of 0 and 1. As the clock changes from 0 to 1, a CPU operation starts. Clock speed is the time taken for one clock cycle to complete.
- Therefore the higher the clock speed, the more CPU operations can be completed per second, resulting in a faster CPU

### Number of Cores

- A core is an independent processor that can run its own fetch decode execute cycle. For example, a processor with 4 cores can run 4 FDE cycles simultaneously, and therefore is 4x faster. A processor with 8 cores is 8x faster.

### Cache size

- Cache memory is storage inside the CPU. Because it is so close to the CPU, it is very fast. However the storage capacity is very small.
- Cache memory stores frequently used instructions, making them faster to access
- More cache memory means that more instructions can be performed faster.
