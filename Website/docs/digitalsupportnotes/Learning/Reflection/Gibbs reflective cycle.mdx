` - ` **Description** <code className="pinknumbercode">-</code> of the experience <br />
` - ` **Feelings** <code className="pinknumbercode">-</code> and thoughts about the experience <br />
` - ` **Evaluation** <code className="pinknumbercode">-</code> of the experience, both good and bad <br />
` - ` **Analysis** <code className="pinknumbercode">-</code> to make sense of the situation <br />
` - ` **Conclusion** <code className="pinknumbercode">-</code> about what you learned and what you could have done differently <br />
` - ` **Action plan** <code className="pinknumbercode">-</code> for how you would deal with similar situations in the furutre, or general changes you might find appropriate <br />
