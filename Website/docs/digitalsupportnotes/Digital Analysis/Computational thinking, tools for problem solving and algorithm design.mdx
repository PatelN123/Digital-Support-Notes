## Process of computational thinking:
`•` Decomposition - breaking down a complex problem or system into manageable components <br />
`•` Pattern recognition - identification of patterns within problems <br />
`•` Abstraction - analyse information, filter and remove unnecessary detail <br />
`•` Action: <br />
`-` Sequence - order of processes <br />
`-` Selection - execution only when conditions met <br />
`-` Iteration - repetition until conditions met <br />

## Tools for problem solving and algorithm design:
`•` Decomposition diagram <br />
`•` Flowchart  <br />
`•` Pseudo code  <br />
