The ITIL framework will help an organisation to define its IT service

Align services with customer' needs and produce a clear model for outgoing success.

It is used to improve core IT service processes and is flexible to each organisation's unique
requirements

A modular structure means implementation and improvements can be made in stages.

There are different levels of ITIL certification for IT and digital professionals to develop their
understanding of the framework.
