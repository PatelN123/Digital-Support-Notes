Incident management is typically closely aligned with the service desk, which is the single point of contact for all users communicating with IT. <br />
When a service is disrupted or fails to deliver the promised performance during normal service hours, it is essential to restore the service to normal operation as quickly as possible. <br />
Any condition that has the potential to result in a breach or degradation of service ought to trigger a response that prevents the actual disruption from occurring. These are the objectives of incident management. <br />
