When you have a big idea that you want to get right, it can save you a lot of time and money to concept test it before you bring it to the world. 

Concept testing allows you to refine a product concept, advertisement, new logo, website etc by getting feedback directly from your target market.

### Example:

A marketing team might hold a brainstorming session to come up with ideas for an advertising campaign for a new product. When the session is over, there are dozens of options on the table, and a few seem like real winners. 

Questions may include:

- Does this ad stand out against my competitors' ad?

- Does this ad capture viewers/listeners attention?

- Do you recognise this brand?

- Would you trust this brand?

- Which button would make you buy?
