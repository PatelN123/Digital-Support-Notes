You can be discriminated against for many different reasons. These include:

### Age

You can be discriminated on your age when looking for a job. Employers may want a younger employee for a long term job, or they may want an older employee who has experience.


### Disability

When you are treated less well or put at a disadvantage for a reason that relates to your disability. Some employers may see the disability and see the time off you may have because of it.


### Gender reassignment

Its unlawful for your employer to treat you worse or less favourably than they would if you were absent because of sickness or injury.

### Marriage & civil partnership

An employer may rather a single or married employee. This is because if the job required travelling or a long time spent at work, a married employee may be less likely to want to travel whereas the single employee would be more willing to.

### Pregnancy and maternity

An employer may discriminate you, if you're pregnant as they will have to find someone else to take your position while you’re away.

### Race

You may be discriminated against because of one or more aspects of your race, for example people born in Britain to Jamaican parents could be discriminated against because they are British citizens, or because of their Jamaican national origins.

### Religion or belief

**The Equality Act 2010 says you must not be discriminated against because:**

- You are (or are not) of a particular religion
- You hold (or do not hold) a particular philosophical belief
- Someone thinks you are of a particular religion or hold a particular belief (this is known as discrimination by perception)
- You are connected to someone who has a religion or belief (this is known as discrimination by association)

Example:
 Refusing you a bank loan because you're Jewish.

### Sex

**The Equality Act 2010 says you must not be discriminated against because:**

- You are (or are not) a particular sex
- Someone thinks you are the opposite sex (this is known as discrimination by perception)
- You are connected to someone of a particular sex (this is known as discrimination by association)

### Sexual orientation

You may be discriminated for being heterosexual, gay, lesbian or bisexual and if someone thinks you are of a certain orientation by looking at you, and the way you act.
