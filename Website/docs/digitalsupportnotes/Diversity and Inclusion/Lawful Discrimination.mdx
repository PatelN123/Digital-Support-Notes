There are cases when it is ok to descriminate, those are:

### Age

An employer could put an upper age limit on a job where very high levels of physical fitness are required and could not be fulfilled by someone older

### Disability

For a person with a disability to be treated more favourably than people without that disability

### Gender Reassignment

Provide extra mental support for someone who had a gender reassignment

### Race

An organisation is taking positive action to encourage or develop people in a racial group that is under-represented or disadvantaged in a role or activity.
For example, a broadcaster gets hardly any applicants for its graduate recruitment programme from Black Caribbean candidates. It sets up a work experience and mentoring programme for Black Caribbean students to encourage
them into the industry
