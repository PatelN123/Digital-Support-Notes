## CIA
In security terms, `CIA` stands for: **Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability** <br />
These three principles form the cornerstone of any organisation's security infrastructure.

### Confidentiality
Confidentiality has been written about here [Confidentiality](/docs/confidentiality/ "pageRef")

### Integrity
Integrity is about ensuring that data has not been tampered with and can be trusted. It is correct, authentic and reliable. <br />

Integrity can be compromised directly by methods including: <br />
**Deliberately** <br />
` - ` Tampering with intrusion detection systems <br />
` - ` Modifying configuration files <br />
` - ` Changing system logs to evade detection <br />

**Unintentionally:** <br />
` - ` Through human error <br />
` - ` Lack of care <br />
` - ` Coding errors <br />
` - ` Inadequate policies, procedures, and protection mechanisms <br />

#### How can integrity be ensured?
` - ` Encryption <br />
` - ` Hashing <br />
` - ` Digital signatures <br />
` - ` Digital certificates <br />
` - ` Intrusion detection systems <br />
` - ` Auditing <br />
` - ` Version control <br />
` - `  Strong authentication mechanisms and access controls <br />

### Availability
Availability means that networks, systems and applications are up and running. It ensures authorused users have timely, reliable access to resources when they're needed <br />
Things can jeopardise availability, including: <br />
` - ` Hardware or software failure <br />
` - ` Power failure <br />
` - ` Natural disasters <br />
` - ` Human error <br />

:::tip Example
The most well known attack that threatens availability is the denial of service attack, in which the performance of a systsm, website, web based application/service is degraded and the syste, becomes unreachable.

#### How can availibility be ensured?
` - ` Redundancy (in servers, networks, applications and services) <br />
` - ` Hardware fault tolerance (for servers and storage) <br />
` - ` Regular software patching and system upgrades <br />
` - ` Backups <br />
` - ` Comprehensive disaster recovery plans <br />
` - ` Denial-of-service protection solutions <br />


## IAAA
This is **Identification, Authentication, Authorisation and Accountability** <br />
These are key concepts to understanding identity access management. <br />


### Identification
This is **who you are** <br />
Without identifying yourself, you cannot access a system <br />
Normal methods of identification includes: <br />
` - ` Your name <br />
` - ` Username <br />
` - ` ID number <br />

### Authentication
After you've identified yourself, you need to prove you are who you say you are. That is `authentication`. <br />
Authentication methods: <br />
` - ` Something you know, password <br />
` - ` Something you have, token <br />
` - ` Something you are, fingerprint <br />
` - ` Something you are, IP address <br />
` - ` Something you can do, signature <br />

### Authorisation
Once you've identified and proved who you are using authentication, you will be given access to the system once your authorisation has been determined. <br />
**What is authorisation** <br />
` - `  Authorisation determines which part of the system / data you are allowed to access and what actions you are allowed to do with that access. For example, read and write. <br />

### Accountability
Once you've been given access to a system and authorised to perform certain tasks, accountability takes place. <br />
**What is accountability?** <br />
` - ` Being able to trace an action back to an individual <br />
` - ` Prove what someone did, and when they did it: known as `non-repudiation` <br />
` - ` This is also known as auditing (audit logs)

## Maintaining CIA

**Why is it important?**

` - ` Maintains compliance with legislation <br />
` - ` Maintains trust with internal and external stakeholders <br />
` - ` Promotes positive brand image <br />
` - ` Avoids security risks and unauthorised access <br />

## Lack of CIA

**Consequenses** <br />

**Financial** <br />
` - ` Regulatory fines <br />
` - ` Refunds/compensation to customers <br />
` - ` Loss of earnings <br />

**Legal** <br />
` - ` Lawsuits <br />
` - ` Termination of contract <br />

**Reputational** <br />
` - ` Loss of customers <br />
` - ` Damage to brand <br />
