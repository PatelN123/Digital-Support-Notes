**Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)**

Normally achieved by devices such as managed switches which enables a physical network to be segmented into multiple logical networks. This reduces traffic on each virtual network. 

To create a Virtual LAN, the network equipment, such as routers and switches must support VLAN configuration. 

The hardware is typically configured using a software admin tool that allows the network to customise the virtual network. The admin software can be used to assign individual ports or groups of ports on a switch to a specific VLAN. 

For example, ports 1-12 on switch #1 and ports 13-24 on switch #2 could be assigned to the same VLAN.
